- 👋 Hi, I’m @jessica-woodgate
- 👀 I’m interested in applied ethics, in particular AI ethics and its implications for justice and fairness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about applying fairness principles in multiple-user social dilemmas within socio-technical systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects related to the intersection of computer science and ethics - not necessarily just AI!
- 📫 How to reach me: yp19484@bristol.ac.uk.
